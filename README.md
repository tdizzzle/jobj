## Java render


How do I make this myself / add to it and do seomthing interesting?

First thoughts

- tool bar - first
- add different shapes
- more colours
- export to image?
- add tabs to the top tool bar
- once some basic rendering has happend? Then what where does it go


### Tool bar design

- shape drop down 
- import obj files and go hog wild - keep it simple? - later
- export to obj, with zoomed or new coordiantes

### Compile and run

```cmd
javac DemoViewer.java && java DemoViewer
```
